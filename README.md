## what is finesse?
finesse is a concept used in tetris to optimize the number of keypresses used to place a piece in any given position. 

**finessy** uses the super rotation system (SRS) in its calculations! every single position can be achieved in 3 keypresses (4 if you count the harddrop)

the user has three keys for rotation: `clockwise`, `counter-clockwise`, and `180 degrees`. this means that rotating a tetromino into position will take at most 1 keypress.

the user has two keys for movement: left and right. however, we also have the option to use `delayed auto shift (DAS)`. if you hold down the `left` key, the tetromino will slide to the leftmost edge of the board, and we count this as one keypress. this makes it possible to achieve every position on the board in minimal keypresses!

## what is finessy?
**finessy** is a training game that allows the user to practice finesse without distractions: instead of building and clearing lines, the user is given a single piece and a target position to finesse it into :D

there are options to select which pieces to practice and whether to randomize the order. try to get a high streak! 

## the next level...
you already got a 162 long streak?? whoa.

here are some other ways to perfect your finesse:
- [TETR.IO](tetr.io) 40L or Blitz modes: trying to clear lines as fast as you can or get as many points in a certain amount of time. if you select "alert on finesse fault" it will make a little noise every time you make a mistake... or you can be extra brave and select "retry on finesse fault" (it restarts your whole game)
- [APOTRIS](https://akouzoukos.com/apotris) Finesse Trainer: build infinitely, but you get to retry that block when you make a finesse fault
- recognizing your finesse doesn't have to be perfect for it to improve your game :)
